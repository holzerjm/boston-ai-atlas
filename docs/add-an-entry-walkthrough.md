# Add an entry to the Boston AI Atlas — a click-by-click walkthrough

**For:** anyone helping maintain the atlas. **No coding needed** — everything is done in
a web browser on github.com. **Time:** about 10–15 minutes per entry.

> This is the friendly, hand-it-to-anyone version. For the full reference (all fields,
> flag handling, troubleshooting) see [`MAINTAINING.md`](../MAINTAINING.md).

When someone fills in the **"➕ Suggest an entry"** form, it becomes a GitHub *issue* — a
wish-list note. Your job is to turn it into a real entry in the file `data.js` and save it
as a *pull request* (a proposed change). Here's how, start to finish.

---

## Step 1 — Open the suggestion

1. Go to the repo → **Issues** tab.
2. Click the suggestion you're working on. You'll see the org name, website, category,
   address, description, and so on.

## Step 2 — Look up the map pin (the only thing the form doesn't ask for)

The form gives you an **address** but not the map coordinates. Get them in 20 seconds:

1. Open **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)** and search the address.
2. **Right-click** the exact spot.
3. The first menu item is two numbers, e.g. `42.3626, -71.0843`. **Click it** to copy.
4. The **first** number is `lat`, the **second** is `lng`. Hold onto them for Step 3.

> No fixed address (a meetup that moves venues)? Use the neighborhood (e.g. "Kendall Sq")
> and add `approx: true` to the entry.

## Step 3 — Fill in the entry

Copy this template into a notes app and replace the blanks:

```js
{id:"", name:"", cat:"", loc:"",
 lat:0, lng:0, url:"https://",
 desc:"",
 why:"",
 tags:[], stages:[], links:[]},
```

| Field | What to put |
|------|-------------|
| `id` | A short nickname in **lowercase-with-hyphens** you invent from the name (e.g. `Acme AI` → `acme-ai`). Must be unique. |
| `name` | The display name, in quotes. |
| `cat` | The category **code** — translate the form's label with the table below. |
| `loc` | The street address (or neighborhood) in quotes. |
| `lat`, `lng` | The two numbers from Step 2 (no quotes). |
| `url` | The website. **Must start with `https://`** |
| `desc` | 1–2 plain, factual sentences (max 400 characters). Trim any marketing language. |
| `why` | One sentence: why an early-stage founder should care. |
| `tags` | 2–4 short lowercase tags, each in quotes: `["robotics","lab space"]` |
| `stages` | The founder stages it serves, as **numbers** — see the table below: `[1,3]` |
| `links` | Usually leave as `[]`. (Advanced: ids of related entries.) |

**Category — form label → `cat` code:**

| Form says | Use |
|---|---|
| AI Companies & Startups | `"startup"` |
| Venture Capital | `"vc"` |
| Angel Groups | `"angel"` |
| Accelerators & Founder Support | `"accel"` |
| University Labs & Centers | `"university"` |
| Corporate AI Labs | `"corporate"` |
| Communities & Meetups | `"community"` |
| Major Events | `"event"` |
| Government & Policy | `"gov"` |
| Spaces & Hubs | `"space"` |
| Student Groups | `"student"` |

**Stages — checkbox → number** (list every box they ticked, e.g. Build + Fund → `[3,4]`):

| Checkbox | Number |
|---|---|
| 💡 Spark | `1` |
| 🔬 Validate | `2` |
| 🔧 Build | `3` |
| 💸 Fund | `4` |
| 🚀 Scale | `5` |

## Step 4 — Add it to `data.js`

1. Open **`data.js`** in the repo and click the **pencil ✏️ icon** ("Edit this file").
   *If GitHub mentions making "your own copy" or a "fork," that's normal — just continue.*
2. Press **Cmd-F** (Mac) / **Ctrl-F** (Windows) and type the category banner, e.g.
   `VENTURE CAPITAL`. The file is grouped into sections like
   `// ---------- VENTURE CAPITAL ----------`.
3. Click at the start of the line just below that banner and **paste** your entry there,
   among the other entries (order within a section doesn't matter).
4. Check the commas: every entry ends with `},`.

## Step 5 — Save it as a pull request

1. Scroll to the **"Commit changes"** box at the bottom.
2. Message: `Add <Org Name> (closes #<issue number>)` — the `closes #` part auto-closes the
   suggestion when this is merged.
3. Choose **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."**
4. Click **Propose changes** → **Create pull request**.

## Step 6 — Green check, then publish

1. A check named **"Validate atlas data"** runs automatically (~1 minute).
   - **Green ✓** → continue.
   - **Red ✗** → click **Details** to see the message, fix it (Step 4 again), and re-commit.
     See the troubleshooting table in [`MAINTAINING.md`](../MAINTAINING.md).
2. When it's green, click **Merge pull request → Confirm merge** (or leave the final merge
   to a maintainer). The suggestion closes itself. 🎉
3. **Publishing to the live site** is a separate deploy step a maintainer runs — see
   [`MAINTAINING.md`](../MAINTAINING.md) → *Publish to the live site*.

## A complete worked example

A suggestion comes in: *Epipelagic Ventures · https://www.epipelagic.vc · Venture Capital ·
1 Broadway, Cambridge · "founder-first venture studio…" · stages: Build + Fund.* You look up
`1 Broadway, Cambridge` in Google Maps → `42.3626, -71.0843`, translate **Venture Capital →
`vc`** and **Build + Fund → `[3,4]`**, and write:

```js
{id:"epipelagic", name:"Epipelagic Ventures", cat:"vc", loc:"1 Broadway, Cambridge",
 lat:42.3626, lng:-71.0843, url:"https://www.epipelagic.vc",
 desc:"A founder-first venture studio in Kendall Square that surrounds early-stage startups with capital, mentorship and hands-on operational support to reach their next milestone.",
 why:"A hands-on venture-studio model for pre-seed founders — especially edtech, consumer, health and wellness, or moonshot ideas — pairing funding with active build support.",
 tags:["venture studio","early stage"], stages:[3,4], links:[]},
```

…then paste it into the `// ---------- VENTURE CAPITAL ----------` section. Done.
