# Maintainer Guide — Mass AI Atlas

This guide is for the people who **keep the atlas up to date**. It assumes you are
comfortable using a web browser but **not** that you use Git or GitHub every day —
almost everything here is done by pointing and clicking on **github.com**.

There are two ways new information arrives:

1. **An Issue** — someone filled in the "Suggest an entry" form. It's a wish-list
   item written in plain English. *Your job: turn it into a real entry in `data/entities.yml`.*
2. **A Pull Request (PR)** — someone who knows Git already wrote the entry for you and
   is proposing the exact change. *Your job: check it and merge it.*

> **What is `data/entities.yml`?** It's the single file that holds every organization
> on the map. It's a list of "entries," and each entry is a small block of fields like
> `name`, `category`, `location`, and so on. Everything you do ends up as an edit to
> this one file.

## The big picture (read this once)

```
  Someone suggests       You turn it into        A robot double-checks      You publish
  an org (Issue)   ──▶  an entities.yml entry ──▶ the entry (automatic) ──▶  to the live site
       │                  (Part 1 or 2)            (the green ✓ check)        (Part 3)
       │
  …or sends a ready-made edit (Pull Request) ─────────────────────────────────▶
```

- Every change to `data/entities.yml` is **automatically checked by a robot** (GitHub Actions
  CI). It catches the most common mistakes — duplicate names, bad coordinates,
  missing fields — and shows a green ✓ or a red ✗. You do **not** have to memorize the
  rules; the robot is your safety net.
- Nothing goes to the public website until **you publish it** (Part 3).

---

## Part 1 — Turn an Issue into a `data/entities.yml` entry

Use this when someone used the **"➕ Suggest an entry"** form.

> **Shortcut — let the bot draft it for you.** After you've eyeballed a
> suggestion issue and it looks real (not spam), add the **`bot:draft`** label.
> A bot reads the form, geocodes the address, builds the entry, and opens a
> **draft pull request** with a review checklist — turning the rest of this
> Part into "check the draft and merge." The bot never publishes anything; you
> still verify the org and merge (which is what puts it live). If the bot can't
> parse the form it comments on the issue and you do it by hand as below. Re-run
> after the submitter edits: remove and re-add `bot:draft`. (Requires the bot's
> token secret to be configured — see PROJECT_STATE.md §3.)

### Step 1 — Open the issue

1. Go to the repository on github.com → click the **Issues** tab.
2. Click the issue (suggestions are labelled **`new-entry`**).
3. You'll see the form they filled in: organization name, website, category,
   location, description, why it matters, stages, tags, and connections.

### Step 2 — Look up the map coordinates (the one thing the form doesn't ask for)

The form collects an **address** but not latitude/longitude. You need those two
numbers so the pin lands in the right spot.

1. Open **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)** and search the address.
2. **Right-click** the exact spot on the map.
3. The very first item in the little menu is two numbers, e.g. `42.3629, -71.0838`.
   **Click it** — that copies them.
4. The **first** number is `lat`, the **second** is `lng`.

> If the org doesn't have one fixed address (a meetup that moves around, etc.), use the
> neighborhood (e.g. "Kendall Sq") and add `approx: true` to the entry.

### Step 3 — Build the entry

Copy this template and fill it in. Field-by-field help is in
[Appendix A](#appendix-a--field-by-field-cheat-sheet); a filled-in example is below it.

```yaml
- id: 
  name: 
  cat: 
  loc: 
  lat: 0
  lng: 0
  url: https://
  badge: 
  desc: 
  why: 
  tags: []
  stages: []
  links: []
  added: 
  lastVerified: 
```

> **YAML tips.** Keep the shape exactly: `- id:` at the very start of the line, every
> other field indented by **two spaces**, no commas at line ends. Text needs no quotes —
> *unless* it contains a colon followed by a space (`: `) or ` #`, or starts with a quote,
> bracket, `&`, `*`, `!`, `|`, `>`, `%` or `@`. Then wrap the whole value in double
> quotes, e.g. `name: "Acme: The AI Lab"`.

Three fields need a quick "translation" from the form's words into the code's words —
the tables in Appendix A do this for you:

- **Category** — the form says *"Venture Capital"*; the code wants `vc`. → see the
  [category table](#category-the-cat-field).
- **Stages** — the form has checkboxes like *"🔧 Build"*; the code wants numbers like
  `3`. → see the [stage table](#stages-the-stages-field).
- **id** — you invent this: the name in **lowercase-with-hyphens**, e.g.
  `Acme AI Labs` → `acme-ai`. Keep it short and make sure it's not already used (in the
  GitHub file view, press **`/`** or `Ctrl/Cmd-F` and search the id).

Delete the `badge` line if there's nothing special (an empty value is an error). `links` is
optional — see Appendix A. For `added` **and** `lastVerified`, put **today's month** as
`YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2026-08`) — the entry joins the atlas now, and you just verified
the org by building it.

### Step 4 — Add it to `data/entities.yml` (right in the browser)

1. In the repo, open the **`data`** folder and click **`entities.yml`**.
2. Click the **pencil ✏️ icon** ("Edit this file") near the top right.
3. `entities.yml` is split into **category sections**, each starting with a comment banner
   like `# ---------- VENTURE CAPITAL ----------`. Scroll to the section that matches
   your entry's category and paste your filled-in block **between two other entries
   there** — just before a line starting with `- id:` (order within a section doesn't
   matter).
4. Double-check the indentation: your `- id:` line starts at the very left, and every
   other line of your entry is indented by exactly two spaces, like its neighbours.

### Step 5 — Save it as a Pull Request (this is easier than it sounds)

1. Scroll to the bottom of the edit page to the **"Commit changes"** box.
2. In the message, write something like `Add Acme AI Labs (closes #12)` — putting
   **`closes #` and the issue number** automatically closes the suggestion when this
   is merged.
3. Choose **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."**
   (A "branch" is just a safe scratch copy; this keeps `main` clean until it's
   reviewed.)
4. Click **Propose changes**, then **Create pull request** on the next screen.

### Step 6 — Wait for the green check, then merge

1. On the new PR, a check named **"Validate atlas data"** runs automatically.
   - **Green ✓** → the entry is well-formed. Continue.
   - **Red ✗** → click **Details** to see what's wrong, then click the pencil ✏️ on
     `data/entities.yml` again to fix it. [Appendix D](#appendix-d--when-the-robot-complains)
     lists the common ones.
2. When it's green, click **Merge pull request** → **Confirm merge**. (If you're the
   only reviewer, you can merge your own PR.)
3. The suggestion issue closes itself. 🎉

➡️ **The change is now in the repo but not yet on the public website.** Go to
[Part 3 — Publish](#part-3--publish-to-the-live-site).

---

## Part 2 — Review & merge a Pull Request that edits `data/entities.yml`

Use this when a contributor (someone who knows Git) opened a PR themselves. You're the
reviewer, not the author — most of the work is already done.

### Step 1 — Open the PR

1. Repo → **Pull requests** tab → click the PR.

### Step 2 — Check the robot's verdict first

Scroll to the bottom of the **Conversation** tab:

- **Green ✓ "All checks have passed"** → the data is structurally valid. Good sign.
- **Red ✗** → click **Details**. The contributor needs to fix it. Leave a friendly
  comment pointing them to the error (see [Appendix D](#appendix-d--when-the-robot-complains)),
  and wait — the check re-runs every time they push a fix.

The robot checks structure against the schemas in `data/` (no duplicates, valid
category, MA coordinates, `https` links, etc.). It does **not** know whether the org is *real and relevant* — that part
is your judgment, next.

### Step 3 — Read the actual change

1. Click the **Files changed** tab. Added lines are green, removed lines are red.
2. Sanity-check the new entry against this short checklist:

   - [ ] **Real, active, Massachusetts** organization relevant to AI founders
   - [ ] **Factual, neutral description** — no marketing hype or unverifiable superlatives
   - [ ] **Website works** and is the official one (click it)
   - [ ] **Right category** and the **pin location looks correct** (paste the lat/lng into
         Google Maps if unsure)
   - [ ] **No duplicate** of an org already in the atlas
   - [ ] **Carries a current `lastVerified`** (this month, or close to it) — it should
         reflect when the org was actually checked
   - [ ] If the author is **affiliated** with the org, they disclosed it (that's allowed —
         just expected to be stated)

### Step 4 — Approve, or ask for changes

- All good? Click **Review changes** (top right of *Files changed*) → **Approve** →
  **Submit review**.
- Needs a tweak? Same menu → **Request changes**, write what's needed, **Submit
  review**. You can also click the **`+`** on any specific line to comment on it
  directly.

### Step 5 — Merge

Once it's green and approved, click **Merge pull request** → **Confirm merge**.
Prefer **"Squash and merge"** if offered (it keeps history tidy — one clean entry per
contribution).

➡️ Now publish it → [Part 3](#part-3--publish-to-the-live-site).

---

## Part 3 — Publish to the live site

**Publishing is automatic.** When a change to `index.html` or `data/` lands on
`main` (i.e. when you merge a PR, or the robot pushes the badge), a GitHub Action
re-checks the data and copies the files to the web server. Within about a minute
the public atlas at **the-open-accelerator.com/ecosystem** shows the change, and a
summary lands in the TOA Slack channel (what deployed, which entries are new or
updated — or a 🚨 alert if the deploy failed, in which case the live site is simply
unchanged).

So: **merging IS publishing.** There is no step 3 anymore.

If the deploy ever fails (red ✗ on the "Deploy to TOA site" action, or the 🚨 Slack
message): open the failed run from the Actions tab to see why, and know the live site
still serves the previous version — nothing half-deploys. A deploy can also be
triggered by hand from the **Actions tab → Deploy to TOA site → Run workflow**.

Manual fallback (only if GitHub Actions is unavailable), from a computer with the
repo checked out and SSH access to the server:

```bash
git pull
./scripts/sync-to-site.sh <destination>   # copies index.html + atlas-data.js + data/*.yml
```

## The monthly freshness sweep

Every entry carries a `lastVerified` month — the month a maintainer last confirmed the
org is real, active, and the entry's facts are right.

> **The robot starts this for you.** On the 1st of each month, the "Monthly health
> check" action posts two lists to the TOA Slack: URLs that are **broken or have
> moved** (fix these first — a dead link on a "verified" atlas is the worst look),
> and the entries longest without a check — your queue for the month. The same
> report is in the action's job summary, or run it yourself:
> `node scripts/linkcheck.js` and `node scripts/stale.js --cycle 12`.

To keep those honest, do a small sweep about once a month:

1. Run `node scripts/stale.js` on your computer — it lists the entries that have gone
   longest without a check. (No terminal? The robot prints the same list in the **job
   summary** of every CI run.)
2. For each stale org: open its website, fix anything that changed — or confirm it's
   all still right.
3. Bump `lastVerified` to the current month for each one you checked, and put them all
   in **one PR**.

`--cycle 12` sizes that list from the dataset, so it keeps pace as the atlas grows:
every entry comes round within a year without anyone re-tuning a number. At 198
entries that is **17 re-checks a month, about half an hour**. A fixed `--queue`
quietly stops covering everything as soon as entries outrun it — at 13 a month it
would now take **15 months** to come round, against a 12-month threshold.

---

## Appendix A — Field-by-field cheat sheet

Every entry has these fields. ⭐ = required.

| Field | ⭐ | What to put | Example |
|------|----|-------------|---------|
| `id` | ⭐ | A unique nickname in **lowercase-with-hyphens**. Invent it from the name. | `acme-ai` |
| `name` | ⭐ | The display name (must be unique). | `Acme AI Labs` |
| `cat` | ⭐ | The category **key** — translate from the form using the table below. | `startup` |
| `loc` | ⭐ | Street address, or neighborhood if it moves around. | `1 Broadway, Cambridge` |
| `lat` | ⭐ | First coordinate from Google Maps. | `42.3629` |
| `lng` | ⭐ | Second coordinate from Google Maps. | `-71.0838` |
| `approx` |  | Add `approx: true` **only** if the location is neighborhood-level, not exact. | `true` |
| `url` | ⭐ | Official website. **Must start with `https://`**. | `https://acme.ai` |
| `badge` |  | A short highlight, or omit. | `Applications open` |
| `desc` | ⭐ | 1–2 factual sentences (**max 400 characters**). | `A robotics-AI startup…` |
| `why` |  | One sentence on why an early-stage founder should care. | `Hires from hackathons…` |
| `tags` |  | 2–4 short lowercase tags. | `[robotics, lab space]` |
| `stages` |  | Which founder stages it serves — **numbers**, see table below. | `[1, 3]` |
| `links` |  | `id`s of related entries (draws lines in the Galaxy view). Optional. | `[csail, engine]` |
| `offers` | ⭐ | What founders **get**, 1–6 of: `funding` (invests) · `grants` (equity-free money) · `space` · `compute` · `mentorship` · `community` · `talent` · `customers` (pilots/buyers). **Tag everything the org materially provides to an early-stage founder, not just its headline offering** — an accelerator that gives space, mentoring and a check should carry all three, or the "I need…" filter matches on less than the truth. Powers that filter; the suggestion form asks it as a required multi-select, and the validator errors if it is missing. | `[funding, mentorship]` |
| `applyBy` |  | `rolling`, or the **current application deadline** as `'YYYY-MM-DD'`. Shows "Applications open" in the app; past dates auto-hide and the robot warns so you clear or roll them. Only for orgs with a real application (accelerators, grants, programs). | `'2026-10-15'` |
| `applyNote` |  | Short label next to the deadline, max 40 chars. | `Fall 2026 cohort` |
| `facts` |  | Optional "at a glance" table, 1–6 `[label, value]` rows. Labels must be one of: Check size, Stage, Terms, Equity, Board seat, Program length, Cohort size, Focus. Facts rot — only add ones you'd bet on, and re-check them at `lastVerified` time. | `[[Check size, $500K–$2M]]` |
| `added` |  | The month (`YYYY-MM`) the entry **joined the atlas** — set it once to the current month and never change it. Powers the "✨ New" chips, the new-this-month banner, and the "Recently added" sort. | `2026-08` |
| `lastVerified` |  | The month (`YYYY-MM`) a maintainer last **confirmed the org is real, active, and the facts are right** — set it when you actually checked the org, not merely when you edited the entry. New entry → today's month. The robot only warns if it's missing, but always set it. | `2026-08` |

### Category (the `cat` field)

The suggestion form uses friendly labels; `entities.yml` uses the short key on the right
(the full list lives in `data/categories.yml`).

| Form says… | Use `cat:` |
|------------|------------|
| AI Companies & Startups | `startup` |
| Venture Capital | `vc` |
| Angel Groups | `angel` |
| Accelerators & Founder Support | `accel` |
| University Labs & Centers | `university` |
| Corporate AI Labs | `corporate` |
| Communities & Meetups | `community` |
| Major Events | `event` |
| Government & Policy | `gov` |
| Spaces & Hubs | `space` |
| Student Groups | `student` |

### Stages (the `stages` field)

The form has checkboxes; put the matching **numbers** in a list. List every box they
ticked, e.g. Build + Fund → `stages: [3, 4]`.

| Form checkbox | Number |
|---------------|--------|
| 💡 Spark — learn & plug in | `1` |
| 🔬 Validate — test the idea | `2` |
| 🔧 Build — team, space & compute | `3` |
| 💸 Fund — raise your first round | `4` |
| 🚀 Scale — grow & lead | `5` |

### `links` (optional, for the Galaxy view)

If the suggestion lists "Connected entries" (e.g. *"spun out of MIT CSAIL"*), find that
org already in `data/entities.yml`, copy its `id`, and add it to `links`. If you can't find a
match, just leave `links` empty (`[]`). Wrong/unknown ids are caught by the robot.

---

## Appendix B — A complete, filled-in example

A suggestion comes in:

> **Organization:** Acme AI Labs · **Website:** https://acme.ai · **Category:**
> AI Companies & Startups · **Location:** 1 Broadway, Cambridge · **Description:**
> "Robotics-AI startup building warehouse pick-and-place arms." · **Why:** "Hires
> interns straight out of MIT hackathons." · **Stages:** ☑ Build ☑ Fund ·
> **Tags:** robotics, warehouse

You look up `1 Broadway, Cambridge` in Google Maps → `42.3629, -71.0838`, and you write:

```yaml
- id: acme-ai
  name: Acme AI Labs
  cat: startup
  loc: 1 Broadway, Cambridge
  lat: 42.3629
  lng: -71.0838
  url: https://acme.ai
  desc: Robotics-AI startup building warehouse pick-and-place arms.
  why: Hires interns straight out of MIT hackathons.
  tags: [robotics, warehouse]
  stages: [3, 4]
  links: []
  added: 2026-08
  lastVerified: 2026-08
```

…and paste it into the `# ---------- STARTUPS / AI COMPANIES ----------` section of
`data/entities.yml`.

---

## Appendix C — Handling "🚩 Flag" issues (updates & removals)

A **Flag** issue reports that an existing entry is wrong (shut down, moved, wrong
category, dead link…). The fix is the same kind of `data/entities.yml` edit:

1. Open the flag issue; note the **entry id** it names and what's wrong.
2. Edit `data/entities.yml` (pencil ✏️), press **`/`** or `Ctrl/Cmd-F` and search that **id** to
   jump to the entry.
3. Then:
   - **Outdated info / wrong category / wrong location** → fix the relevant field(s).
   - **Moved out of the region or shut down** → delete the whole entry block (from its
     `- id:` line down to the line before the next `- id:`). Also
     **search the file for its id in other entries' `links`** and remove it there, or
     the robot will complain about a broken connection.
4. Commit with `Fix <name> per flag (closes #NN)` → open the PR → green check → merge →
   [publish](#part-3--publish-to-the-live-site).

> **Resolving a flag counts as re-verifying.** Whenever you keep the entry — you fixed
> something, *or* you checked and it was already correct — set its `lastVerified` to the
> current month (`YYYY-MM`). "I looked, and it's fine" is exactly the information the
> field records.

### When to bump `lastVerified` — and when not to

- **Bump it** whenever you actually looked at the org: building a new entry, resolving a
  flag, or a fact-check edit where you opened the org's site and confirmed things.
- **Don't bump it** on mechanical edits — fixing a tag typo, adding a `links` edge,
  reformatting. Bumping without looking corrupts the signal: the field is only useful if
  it truly means "a human checked this org then."

---

## Appendix D — When the robot complains

Open the failed **"Validate atlas data"** check → **Details** to see the message.
Schema errors name the entry and field, e.g. `✗ entities.yml [acme-ai] /url: must match
pattern …`. Common ones:

| Message contains… | Fix |
|-------------------|-----|
| `bad indentation` / `can not read` / other messages with a line number and a `^` marker | A YAML formatting slip at that line — usually indentation (two spaces per field) or text containing `: ` that needs double quotes. |
| `duplicate id` / `duplicate name` | That org (or id) is already in the atlas. Pick a new `id`, or it's a true duplicate — close the issue/PR instead. |
| `/id: must match pattern` | Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens: `acme-ai`, not `Acme_AI`. |
| `unknown category` | The `cat` value must be one of the **keys** in the category table (`vc`, `startup`, …), not the friendly label. |
| `/lat: must be >=` (or `<=`, or `/lng: …`) | A typo in lat/lng, or they're swapped. In Massachusetts, `lat` is around **42** and `lng` is **negative**, around **-71**. |
| `/url: must match pattern` | The URL must start with `https://` (not `http://`) and contain no spaces or quotes. |
| `/desc: must NOT have more than 400 characters` | Trim the description to 400 characters or fewer. |
| `must have required property` | A ⭐ field from Appendix A is missing. |
| `must NOT have additional properties "…"` | A field name is misspelled (e.g. `lastverified`) or isn't one of the fields in Appendix A. |
| `must be string` | A field was left empty (e.g. `badge:` with nothing after it). Fill it in or delete the line. |
| `links to unknown entry` | A value in `links` doesn't match any `id`. Fix the spelling or remove it. |
| `missing lastVerified` (a ⚠ warning, not a failure) | Add the month you last confirmed this entry: `lastVerified: YYYY-MM`. |
| `/lastVerified: must match pattern` | Fix the format: four-digit year, hyphen, two-digit month — e.g. `2026-08`. |
| `lastVerified … is in the future` | Check the date — it can't be later than the current month. |
| `looks like a typo (before 2020)` | The year in `lastVerified` is wrong — fix it (e.g. a mistyped `2016` for `2026`). |

You can re-run the check just by editing the file again and committing — every commit
re-runs the robot automatically.

## Appendix E — Considered and not listed

Research passes keep rediscovering the same candidates. These were checked, found
real, and still left off — recorded so the next pass doesn't redo the work, and so
the reasoning is open rather than a silent judgment.

| Org | Why not |
|---|---|
| **EforAll** (formerly Merrimack Valley Sandbox) | A general small-business accelerator, free and equity-free, but not AI or tech, and since going fully online it is open to anyone in the US. Its Lowell address is an office, with no local cohort or workspace. Listing it would make the atlas a general business-support directory. |
| **Keva Health** | Real, active, Lexington. But it never describes itself as an AI company — the claim rests on a 2022 listing in a programme that helps non-AI companies *adopt* AI. Revisit if it publishes its ML work. |
| **NineTwoThree AI Studio** | Every fact checked out; it is a paid AI development agency. The atlas lists places a founder can get something — funding, space, compute, mentorship, community, talent, customers — not vendors who sell to them. Admitting one agency admits every dev shop in Boston. |
| **Lux Capital** | Listed until October 2026, then removed: its own contact page says New York and Silicon Valley, and no Massachusetts office could be found. It backs Massachusetts companies, but so do dozens of out-of-state funds; a pin implies a presence. |
| **Y Combinator (Boston alumni)** | Listed until October 2026, then removed. Not an organisation with a Massachusetts presence but a category of founders: its `loc` read "Remote / SF (Boston-based founders)" and its `url` was a filtered list of YC companies rather than a front door. YC alumni belong in the atlas as their own entries — several already are. |

The rules those add up to:

- **A pin implies a presence.** An investor or company with no Massachusetts office
  does not get one, however active it is here.
- **AI has to be the org's own claim**, not an inference from one programme listing.
- **The atlas lists what a founder can get, not who sells to them.** Agencies,
  consultancies and vendors are out as a class.
- **Being real and useful is not enough** — it also has to be AI-relevant and
  Massachusetts-based. Say so plainly when declining; a contributor who gets a
  reason can argue with it.
