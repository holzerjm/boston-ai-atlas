# Reliable alarm clock for the "Weekly events refresh" GitHub workflow.
#
# GitHub's own cron scheduler delivers this repo's Monday firings hours late
# or not at all (observed: 5-6h late on 2026-09-07, none by 9am on
# 2026-09-14). This script runs from a plain cron on the origin server and
# asks GitHub to start the workflow via workflow_dispatch — with NO inputs, so
# the workflow's own once-a-week gate decides whether this run does the work.
# The server cron and GitHub's fallback crons can therefore both fire without
# ever producing a double refresh; only a human passing force=true skips it.
#
# Also self-heals GitHub's "workflow disabled after 60 days without pushes":
# if the workflow is not active, it is re-enabled before dispatching.
#
# Needs a fine-grained personal access token with ONLY
#   Repository access: holzerjm/boston-ai-atlas
#   Permissions:       Actions → Read and write
# stored (mode 600) in $TOKEN_FILE. Optional: a Slack incoming-webhook URL in
# $ALERT_FILE — failures are then posted there as well as logged.
#
# Install (as the forge user on the origin server):
#   mkdir -p ~/bin ~/.local/log ~/.config/boston-ai-atlas && chmod 700 ~/.config/boston-ai-atlas
#   cp scripts/trigger-weekly-events.sh ~/bin/ && chmod +x ~/bin/trigger-weekly-events.sh
#   crontab -e →  1 11 * * 1  ~/bin/trigger-weekly-events.sh >> ~/.local/log/weekly-events.log 2>&1
#                 1 12 * * 1  (same)      # 11:01 UTC = 7am EDT, 12:01 UTC = 7am EST; the gate skips the wrong one
#                 1 13 * * 1  (same)      # spare, in case api.github.com was unreachable
#                 1 12 * * 2  (same)      # Tuesday retry if Monday never happened
